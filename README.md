# GTM Skills

Go-to-market skills that turn Claude into a GTM specialist. 62 skills across SEO & AI search, content, outbound, sales, growth, analytics, strategy, ads, social, and CRM — plus a `/bootstrap` command that onboards Claude to your brand, voice, and goals. Built for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code), also compatible with [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork) and any agent that supports the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io).

## Why This Plugin

Most AI assistants give generic marketing advice. This plugin gives Claude the frameworks, workflows, and domain knowledge of an experienced GTM team — so it can write copy in your voice, audit your SEO like a consultant, plan launches like a PMM, and build outbound sequences like an SDR.

The `/bootstrap` command interviews you once about your brand, audience, and voice, then generates a structured project folder that every skill reads before doing anything. The result: Claude doesn't just know marketing — it knows *your* marketing.

## Installation

## Getting Started

### Bootstrap Your Project

Run `/bootstrap` in any project directory. Claude runs an agency-style onboarding interview — asking about your brand, audience, voice, and goals — then generates a structured project:

```
your-project/
├── CLAUDE.md                    # AI instructions: repo structure, naming, workflow, routing
├── about/
│   └── me.md                    # Personal voice, writing style, personality, biography
├── strategy/
│   └── brand.md                 # Brand positioning, messaging, audience, competitors, voice
├── content/
│   ├── ideas.md                 # Content idea backlog
│   ├── calendar.md              # Publishing schedule
│   ├── linkedin/
│   │   ├── drafts/              # Work-in-progress posts
│   │   └── published/           # Archive of published posts
│   ├── twitter/
│   │   ├── drafts/
│   │   └── published/
│   ├── reddit/
│   │   ├── drafts/
│   │   └── published/
│   ├── blog/
│   │   ├── drafts/
│   │   └── published/
│   └── email/
│       ├── drafts/
│       └── published/
└── assets/
    ├── logos/                    # Logo files
    └── brand/                   # Brand visual references
```

| Path | What it captures |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | AI instructions — repo structure, what to read first, naming conventions, content workflow |
| `about/me.md` | Personal voice — your writing style, quirks, references, personality |
| `strategy/brand.md` | Brand identity — positioning, messaging, audience, competitors, voice guidelines |
| `content/` | Working content engine — ideas, calendar, drafts and published content per platform |
| `assets/` | Reusable visual assets — logos, brand files, visual references |

Content files follow the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD_short-topic-slug.md`. Drafts live in `content/[platform]/drafts/` and move to `published/` once live.

Once bootstrapped, every skill reads the relevant context before doing anything. Claude works in your voice, for your brand, from day one.

### Using Skills

Skills activate automatically when Claude detects a matching task. Just describe what you need in natural language:

```
"Audit the SEO on my landing page"
→ Activates seo-audit

"Write a cold email sequence for enterprise CTOs"
→ Activates cold-email-sequence-generator + startup-icp-definer

"Plan a Product Hunt launch for next month"
→ Activates product-hunt-launch + launch-marketing

"Create a 5-email onboarding sequence"
→ Activates email-sequence + onboarding-cro

"Help me figure out pricing for my SaaS"
→ Activates pricing-strategy

"Write a LinkedIn post about our new feature"
→ Activates linkedin-content + copywriting
```

Skills cross-reference each other. Ask Claude to write a cold email and it pulls from your brand positioning (`strategy/brand.md`), your personal voice (`about/me.md`), and your ICP — not from a generic template.

## How It Works

```
claude-gtm-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/          # Plugin manifest
├── commands/
│   └── bootstrap.md         # /bootstrap onboarding command
└── plugins/
    ├── seo/                 # 2 skills
    ├── content/             # 9 skills
    ├── social/              # 15 skills
    ├── outbound/            # 1 skill
    ├── sales/               # 1 skill
    ├── growth/              # 18 skills
    ├── analytics/           # 4 skills
    ├── strategy/            # 8 skills
    ├── ads/                 # 2 skills
    └── crm/                 # 2 skills
```

**Skills** are markdown files with YAML frontmatter that give Claude specialized knowledge for specific tasks. Claude activates them automatically when it detects a matching task — or you can invoke them directly.

**Commands** are explicit actions you trigger. Currently: `/bootstrap`.

Skills reference each other and build on the project structure created by `/bootstrap`. Ask Claude to write a cold email and it pulls from your brand positioning, your voice, and your ICP — not from a generic template.

## Skills

See [ALL_SKILLS.md](ALL_SKILLS.md) for the complete list of 62 skills organized by category.

## Routing Rules

As you work with Claude, it routes new information to the right file automatically:

- Brand info (positioning, messaging, audience insights) → `strategy/brand.md`
- Personal info (writing preferences, quirks, reference examples) → `about/me.md`
- New content ideas → `content/ideas.md`
- Draft content → `content/[platform]/drafts/`
- Published content → `content/[platform]/published/`

## Validation

Skills follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). Run the validator to check all skills:

```bash
./validate-skills.sh
```

This checks frontmatter fields, naming conventions, description quality, and file structure against the official spec. See the [official reference validator](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/tree/main/skills-ref) for the canonical implementation.
